# VB6NameSpaces - Still in BETA
An single NET assembly makes it possible to back-port .NET samples to VB6 by interoperating with VB.NET NameSpaces, instanced as nested class buckets.
This is still a work in progress, however significant strides have been made to fully support VB.NET controls/properties/events and Namespaces directly through advanced dynamic interop. Including, but not limited to: BakcgroundWorkers; Multi-Threading; FileSystemWatchers; Form Designer; and 64 bit support are now made available to VB6.
